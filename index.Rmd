##Filtering Rows and Colomns

With SQL you can filter colomns with SELECT and rows with WHERE. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database. First we need to load some packages. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)

```
Suppose we want to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yabkees. We could write the following.
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, yearID, teamID, HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)

```
